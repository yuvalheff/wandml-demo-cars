# Vehicle Collision Prediction - Experiment 1 Analysis

## Executive Summary

This experiment implemented a binary classification model for vehicle collision prediction using telematic data, achieving a PR-AUC of **0.238** with RandomForestClassifier. While falling slightly short of the minimum target (0.25), the results provide valuable insights for model improvement and validate the effectiveness of exposure-based feature engineering approaches.

## Experiment Configuration

- **Target Variable**: `collisions_binary` (converted from multi-class to binary)
- **Model**: RandomForestClassifier with balanced class weights
- **Dataset**: 7,667 training samples, 1,917 test samples  
- **Class Distribution**: Highly imbalanced (95.2% no collisions, 4.8% collisions)
- **Primary Metric**: PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve)

## Performance Results

### Primary Metrics
- **PR-AUC**: 0.238 (target: 0.25, minimum: 0.25)
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.805 (indicates good discrimination ability)
- **Precision**: 22.38% (at default threshold)
- **Recall**: 35.16% (captures 1/3 of collision cases)
- **F1-Score**: 27.35%
- **Accuracy**: 91.13% (largely driven by class imbalance)

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
- **True Positives**: 32 (correctly identified collisions)
- **False Positives**: 111 (false alarms) 
- **True Negatives**: 1,715 (correctly identified safe drives)
- **False Negatives**: 59 (missed collisions)

## Key Findings

### 1. Feature Engineering Success
The exposure-based feature engineering approach proved highly effective:

**Top 5 Most Important Features:**
1. `drive_hours` (14.10%) - Total driving exposure time
2. `hours_per_trip` (11.09%) - Average trip duration 
3. `miles` (10.60%) - Total driving distance
4. `count_accelerations` (10.06%) - Hard acceleration events
5. `count_brakes` (9.23%) - Hard braking events

**Key Insight**: Exposure metrics dominate feature importance, validating the hypothesis that collision risk scales with driving exposure.

### 2. Model Performance Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Strong discrimination ability (ROC-AUC = 0.805)
- Successfully captures exposure-risk relationship
- Reasonable recall (35.16%) for such an imbalanced dataset

**Weaknesses:**
- Low precision (22.38%) leading to many false positives
- Poor probability calibration, especially over-estimating risk at medium confidence levels
- PR-AUC below target threshold

### 3. Class Imbalance Impact
The severe class imbalance (20:1 ratio) significantly affects performance:
- High accuracy is misleading due to majority class dominance
- Precision remains low despite balanced class weights
- Many false positives reduce practical applicability

## Comparison to Baseline

The experiment built upon exploration results showing clear progression:
- **Baseline (no feature engineering)**: PR-AUC = 0.211
- **Final model (with feature engineering)**: PR-AUC = 0.238
- **Improvement**: +13% relative improvement over baseline

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Calibration Issues
The model shows poor probability calibration:
- Over-calibrated at medium confidence levels (14-35% predicted vs 7-8% actual)
- Under-calibrated at high confidence levels (82% predicted vs 60% actual)

### 2. Precision-Recall Trade-off
Current threshold optimization favors recall over precision, leading to:
- High false positive rate (5.7% of safe drivers flagged)
- Limited practical utility for real-world deployment

### 3. Feature Gap Analysis
Missing potentially valuable features:
- Weather conditions during drives
- Traffic density information
- Driver demographic and experience data
- Vehicle-specific characteristics

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Successful Components:
- **Data preprocessing pipeline**: Robust handling of missing values and scaling
- **Feature engineering**: Exposure ratios and behavioral indicators prove effective
- **Model selection**: RandomForest with balanced weights optimal for this dataset
- **Evaluation framework**: Comprehensive visualization and metrics tracking

### MLflow Integration:
- Model successfully packaged and logged
- Complete artifact preservation for reproducibility
- Input/output signature validation working

## Future Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Threshold Optimization**: Implement business-specific cost-sensitive thresholds
2. **Calibration Improvement**: Apply Platt scaling or isotonic regression
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine RandomForest with complementary algorithms
4. **Feature Engineering V2**: Explore temporal patterns and interaction terms

### Strategic Improvements:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather additional contextual features (weather, traffic, demographics)
2. **Temporal Modeling**: Incorporate time-series patterns and seasonality
3. **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Implement asymmetric loss functions reflecting business costs
4. **External Data**: Integrate road conditions, weather, and traffic data

## Context for Next Iteration

This experiment successfully established a baseline with exposure-based feature engineering and validated the RandomForest approach. The PR-AUC of 0.238, while below target, provides a solid foundation for improvement. The primary bottleneck is precision rather than recall, suggesting the next iteration should focus on reducing false positives through improved feature engineering and calibration techniques.

The comprehensive evaluation framework and MLflow integration provide excellent infrastructure for rapid iteration and comparison of future approaches.
